Hi. 
Thanks for the permission to join the recruitment task. I haven't dealt with GraphQL or TypeScript, but I'm sure TypeScript will appear more often in my projects. I'm a huge fan of Vue but I suspect there are some things that could be improved in the Rick & Morty app. Enjoy the SPA and possibly Code Review.
